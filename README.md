FrasteR
==========

Template for custom Fortran operations on R rasters

Simple cases of calling Fortran subroutines from R are provided in Simple.R / Simple.f90,
which show how vector, matrix and array data are passed to and from Fortran subroutines.
Those new to R/Fortran interoperation may wish to familiarise themselves with these.

A more realistic raster-based example will be provided in FrasteR.R / FrasteR.f90
